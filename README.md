# Javascript-Challenge

The UFO-Level-1 directory contains these files:

	* index html file	
	* static directory with the css, images, and javascript files referenced in the index file

1. Use the UFO dataset to write JavaScript code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. The data appended to the html table for each UFO observation is shown below.
	
	* date/time
	* city
	* state
	* country
	* shape
	* duration
	* comments

2. Use the date form in the index file and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input. The user can enter a date and click "Filter Table" to find results that match the input.
